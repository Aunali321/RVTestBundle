# ðŸ‘‹ðŸ§© ReVanced Patches template

This is a template for creating a new ReVanced Patches repository.  
The repository can have multiple patches, and patches from other repositories can be used together.

For an example repository, see [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches).

##  ðŸš€ Get started 

To start using this template, follow these steps:

### 1. [Create a new repository using this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=revanced-patches-template&template_owner=ReVanced)

### 2. Set up the `build.gradle.kts` file

Match the group of the project, the manifest attributes, and the POM that will be published to yours.

### 3.  Set up the `README.md` file[^1]

Add a title, a description, a license and a short summary of the patches that are included in the repository. 

ðŸŽ‰ You are now ready to start creating patches!

## ðŸ”˜ Optional steps

You can also add the following things to the repository:

- [Issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)[^2]
- Contribution guidelines[^3]
- Documentation, if you want to publish your patches as a library[^4]
